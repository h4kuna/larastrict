__Current version is under development.__

```bash
composer require wrkflow/larastrict
```

I've created this project as part of my mission to create `work flow` tools / libraries to make my (and yours) **dev life easier and more enjoyable**. 

Want more tools or want to help? Check [wrk-flow.com](https://wrk-flow.com) or [CONTRIBUTE](CONTRIBUTION.md) (I need help with the documentation, new features, tests).

## Main mission

- Follows Domain Driven Development
- Make the code more testable via Unit tests (for faster tests)
- Make database queries reusable and testable -> `Queries`
- Make caching more reusable and testable -> `CacheMeService`
- Move business logic to `Actions` or `Services`
- Setup Laravel for great docker experience.
